# Hackathon 2020
This is the repository for Houghton Mayfield, Lucas Gompou, Cam Larson, and Aurorans Solis as we take on Hack AZ 2020.

## Challenge
We decided to take on the [Fly.me](https://fly.me/) challenge, as well as participating in the [American Airlines challenge](https://github.com/AmericanAirlines/Flight-Engine/wiki/Hack-Arizona-2020) as a sub-category.

* For the Fly.me challenge, we were given access to their GraphQL API.
  * The GraphQL API provides a large amount of information about flight planning, prices, booking, and other such resources, including Hotel booking.
  * Given access to this resource, we were given free reign to make something interesting with it.

* For American Airlines, we were challenged to use an API relating to airlines in an interesting and innovative way.
  * Because we already were using the Fly.me API, we decided that we could also submit the project for this challenge as well.

# Our Journey
Over the course of the 36 hour period, we worked together as a full stack development team to build a website groundwork, both front and back end, as well as a Googe Home Mini application and a Python webhook server.
